Installation
=============
You should install either anaconda or pyenv and poetry according to the 
official instructions before continuing. You should install everything using
the conda environment defined here. This is built using python 3.8.1.

To do this we can :code:`cd assignment1/` and then we can run 
:code:`conda create --prefrix assignment1/env python=3.8` and this will install
everything for us.
